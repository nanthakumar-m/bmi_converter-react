# ⚖️ BMI Converter – React 

This BMI Converter is a  React application built using Vite. It allows users to input their weight (in kg) and height (in cm), and instantly calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI). Based on the BMI result, it classifies the user's health status (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

The aim of this project was to practice React fundamentals, including component structure, state management, and event handling. Additionally, it helped in understanding how to manage user input and apply basic formulas for dynamic result rendering in a clean and intuitive UI.
